First Steps
-----------

The first thing you should do is contact the band to see when they would be able to come in and play. Then, contact the engineer group, [wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com"), to see if an engineer is able to facilitate the session. When requesting an engineer, make sure you list the instruments the band will be bringing in, as well as the time, date, and length of the show. If an engineer is available, go ahead and book the session. If not, try finding another day for the band to come in and check again to see if an engineer is free. You should email the engineers list at least two weeks in advance to increase your chances of finding someone who is able to come in.

When you email the band to request them on your show, encourage them to read the [Guidelines for Artists](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Recording_%26_Live/For_Bands "Recording & Live/For Bands") so that they can get some more information about what to do, what’s expected, etc. Make sure that they are aware of our location on campus as well as the fact that they must carry all of their equipment up to the third floor themselves. Timing is also critical so that the band is ready to go live at the desired time. The band should respect the timeline if they want to sound good.

Host Responsibilities
---------------------

As a host, you are in charge of the band while they are at the station. This means that you are required to show up before the band arrives and stay until they have left. You are also the intermediary between the band and the engineer. If the band is having problems with the engineer, or vice versa, they should come to you and you should help resolve the issue.

Lastly, you are in charge of the band, and the engineer is in charge of the session. Both you and the engineer’s priority will be getting the band playing on time and sounding as good as possible. The engineer will try to to accommodate all requests from you or the band (such as photography or assistance loading equipment), but this will be done at the sole discretion of the engineer running the session. No such service should be implied or offered to the artist with out first consulting the engineer.

Summary

-   Contact the band you want to host, then contact engineer group two at least two weeks before the session with all the details of session (date,time,length of show, instruments)
-   Direct bands to the band guidelines web-page: [https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Recording\_%26\_Live/For\_Bands](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Recording_%26_Live/For_Bands "Recording_&_Live/For_Bands")
-   Be present the whole session, from the moment the band arrives to the time they leave
-   The engineer is in charge of session. Work with him/her and the band to make everything run as smooth as possible.
-   WMFO strives to be the best live radio venue around. Help us make this happen!
