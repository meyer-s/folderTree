There is no list of words that are not allowed on the radio, and obscenities are not always just words: the intent of a song may also be deemed as obscene. You are expected to use good judgement and common sense, and to be respectful of the listening audience.

In general: when in doubt, DON’T. If you have ANY QUESTIONS as to whether material is considered to be in violation of this policy, please check with the Program Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org").

1.  Between the hours of 6 AM and 10 PM, the broadcast of profane, indecent, or explicit material is not allowed. Rule of thumb: you should say or play only what you would feel comfortable delivering to a family with an eight year old child in the car. If your content probably deserves a verbal warning, it’s probably not right for this time.

2.  During "safe harbor hours" AFTER 10PM at night and BEFORE 6AM, the broadcast of material with limited indecent, profane, or explicit subject matter or content shall be permitted. Verbal warnings are highly recommended before and during such content if listeners may deem it objectionable.

A live DJ or guest should NEVER swear on­air, as this conduct is considered highly unprofessional. DJs and their guests should be aware of the listening audience when discussing indecent content, such as discussing sexual topics, violence, or other mature issues. Artists who are performing live on­air are not required to censor their content provided it does not violate FCC rules or this policy as a whole.

At all times, the level of profanity, indecency, and explicit content shall be justified by the socially relevant message contained within the piece. You, as the broadcaster, should be able to provide that justification for material you air either to the executive board or to the FCC.

The WMFO executive board and Programming Director will enforce this policy to the extent allowed in the constitution, including written warnings, suspensions, and mandatory retraining. All questions about this policy and potentially obscene material should be directed to the Program Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org").
