WMFO now has lovely air conditioning! That is awesome and you should enjoy it often during the long summer months.

However, the AC is a communal resource and we need everyone's cooperation to make it work and to keep WMFO comfortable and keep our expensive equipment safe.

When shall you observe these policies?

When the Operations Director has turned on the AC units in the Summer until the Operations Director has shut off the AC units in the fall, please follow all the below instructions. The Operations Director will notify you about these in an almost annoying fashion over email, sign, and wiki update.

Policies
--------

Please do not:

1.  Alter any settings on the AC units (temp, fan, mode).
2.  Open the windows (even if you like the weather today)
3.  Leave the door to Studio C closed after you leave (C is cooled by Annex unit; equipment will overheat)

 

Here is what you can and should do:

1.  Follow all written instructions from the Operations Director.
2.  During your show you may turn off the AC unit in Studio A to reduce on-air volume. (DJs also find that a bit of background music masks the noise effectively.)
3.  If you choose to do 1 above, you MUST turn the unit back on after completion of your show.
4.  Alert [ops@wmfo.org](mailto:ops@wmfo.org "mailto:ops@wmfo.org") if someone has violated any of the policies above.

Bad Excuses for Violating Policies
----------------------------------

We are very fortunate to have the AC this summer but we need your cooperation to make the AC work well this summer. The following excuses for violating these policies are bad and team ops will still get mad at you:

-   Just because today is "nice out" does not mean that tomorrow will also be "nice out." The air conditioner shuts off when it reaches appropriate temperature. That means the next day when it is warmer the AC unit will turn back on and run continuously, possibly breaking it.
-   AC units cost money to run. Equipment costs significantly more money to replace when it overheats. Do not sacrifice \$5,000 of equipment for \$0.30 of electricity.
-   If you have a philosophical problem with AC units, sorry but you'll have to leave the units on.

Instructions for Engineers (B, Dee)
-----------------------------------

These are best practices for making AC happy in B, Dee.

### Setup

There are two systems:

1.  A window unit in Dee to cool the right half of the station.
2.  A wireless thermostat which drives the built-in AC system to keep B at optimal temperature.

### When you leave

-   Dee should be set according to the mark, sign, or instructions next to the unit.
-   Dee's door should be open.
-   B's thermostat should be set as marked and left in B.
-   B's door should be closed.

### During sets

A few recommendations:

1.  Leave the unit on during most of the sound check (deal with the noise).
2.  Before on-air broadcast, turn the unit up all the way to "ice the room."
3.  Turn the unit off during the broadcast
4.  At the conclusion of the broadcast, return the unit to its default setting.
5.  Do not forget to return the temperature to its default setting.
