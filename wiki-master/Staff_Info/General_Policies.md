This page discusses basic WMFO Programming policies and station rules. Questions regarding this material should be directed to the [Programming Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept. "Programming Dept.").

Broadcast Regulations
---------------------

-   Be aware of the [profanity and indecency policy](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/General_Policies/Profanity%2C_Indecency%2C_and_Obscenity "Profanity, Indecency, and Obscenity").
-   DJs must play or read at least one public service announcement (PSA) per hour.
-   DJs must play or say a correct station ID within five minutes of the top and bottom of the hour (i.e. between 3:55 and 4:05 and then between 4:55 and 5:05). A correct station ID is “WMFO Medford” or “WMFO in Medford.”
-   DJs must have a Spinitron account and log all material played on air at the time it is played.
-   DJs must answer the listener lines if they ring during their shows. Before putting any caller on-air, the DJ running the board must brief the caller on our profanity policy and tell the caller that he or she will be on the air. If the caller subsequently violates our profanity policy, the DJ must immediately remove the caller from the air.

Discrimination and Sexual Harassment
------------------------------------

Violations of Tufts' official [non-discrimination](http://oeo.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Non-Discrimination-Policy-2012.pdf "http://oeo.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Non-Discrimination-Policy-2012.pdf") and/or [sexual harassment](http://oeo.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Harassment-Policy-2012.pdf "http://oeo.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Harassment-Policy-2012.pdf") policies will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action including suspension or dismissal, as well as criminal prosecution.

Drugs and Alcohol
-----------------

WMFO has a zero tolerance drugs and alcohol policy. Staff members and/or guests found to be in the possession of and/or under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol while in the station will be subject to immediate dismissal. In addition, no staff member or guest may pretend to be or claim to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol while in the station.

Property
--------

Staff members and/or guests may not attempt to fix, modify, or remove any equipment or property at WMFO without written permission from the WMFO Executive Board.

Graffiti
--------

Staff members may not graffiti on or sticker over windows, window shades, finished woodwork, equipment, or surfaces painted red. Graffiti should not be vulgar. Please do not draw genitalia on any surfaces at WMFO. We admire our staff members' creativity, and know that all of our staff members can do better than that. All vulgar graffiti will be removed.

Food and Drink
--------------

Food and drink **are not** permitted in any of WMFO’s studios. Food and drink **are** permitted in common areas, such as the hallway, vinyl library, and lounge.

Shows
-----

If applying for a show, DJs must submit a completed show application packet. A show application packet consists of one Show Form attached to the DJ Agreements for all DJs applying for the show. DJs might not keep their current time slots or get a show at all. The final decision lies entirely with the Programming Director and Executive Board, who are responsible for creating the semester program schedule. The Executive Board may need to cancel shows during the season to accommodate special events.

Subs
----

If assigned a show time, DJs must attend every show on time and for its full duration, or find a substitute by sending an email to [wmfo-sublist@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-sublist@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-sublist@googlegroups.com"). There is a maximum of three (3) substitutions allowed per season. If something unexpected happens, or if a DJ will otherwise be absent for more than three (3) shows and need more substitutions, the DJ must contact the Programming Director as soon as possible.

Volunteering
------------

**All regular DJs **are required to complete at least five (5) hours of volunteering per semester, no more than two (2) of which may count from subbing. **DJs without regular shows (subs)** must complete at least three (3) non-subbing volunteer hours per semester to retain station access. Failure to complete volunteer hours will affect station access rights and future show times. All DJs are required to log all volunteer hours in the volunteering log by the station entrance.

Guests
------

Staff members are responsible for the behavior of all guests while they are at WMFO and/or on the air. Guests may not operate WMFO equipment or run a show on their own. Guests should not create Spinitron accounts and will not be granted card access to the station.

Staff Meetings
--------------

All WMFO staff members are required to attend all semester staff meetings unless prior notice is given to the WMFO Executive Board. Any staff member who misses a semester staff meeting is responsible for reading the meeting minutes and instructional documents posted on the WMFO Wiki after the meeting.

Newsgroups
----------

All staff members must be a member of and regularly read the WMFO-Staff ([http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff")) and WMFO-Sublist ([http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist")) Google groups.

The Community File
------------------

Any DJ who covers community-related topics on the air must file a report for WMFO’s community file by logging the community topics covered on Spinitron. Please write "WMFO Community Issue" in the Artist and/or Disk fields, and include a description of the issue(s) covered in the Song and/or Song Notes fields. Please be as detailed as possible.

 

The Political File

Any DJ contacted by a political candidate or airing an interview with a political candidate must file a report for WMFO’s political file. To do this, if contacted by a political candidate, the DJ must email [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org"). To do this, if airing an interview, the DJ must log the interview on Spinitron. Please write "WMFO Political Interview" in the Artist and/or Disk fields, and include a description of the interview in the Song and/or Song Notes fields. Please be as detailed as possible.

The Public File
---------------

If a member of the community calls the studio asking to be let into the station to see WMFO’s public file during business hours, the DJ running the board must show him or her the public file. All staff members are required to know where the public file is located.

Federal Agents
--------------

If a federal agent calls the studio asking to be let into the station during business hours, the DJ running the board must let him or her into the station.

Emergency Alert System (EAS) Instructions
-----------------------------------------

You must be able to produce the Emergency Alert System (EAS) instructions located under the desk in Studio A if asked by a federal agent from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Violations
----------

Violations of any of the binding rules and policies of WMFO are punishable at the discretion of the WMFO Executive Board.

Policy Violations
-----------------

-   Any staff member who is caught in violation of station rules other than the no-tolerance non-discrimination, sexual harassment, and/or drugs and alcohol polices or who is hosting a guest who violates station rules other than the non-discrimination, sexual harassment, and/or drugs and alcohol policies will receive one written warning via e-mail to the address listed on their most recent DJ form.
-   Any staff member in violation of multiple rules or acting in a threatening manner toward station members may be subject to immediate suspension by the Programming Director. 
-   If the problem persists, the Programming Director reserves the right to suspend the individual for up to one month.
-   If an additional violation occurs after the one month suspension, the Programming Director may opt to expel the staff member in question from the station for one semester and recommend retraining or other punitive measures prior to the DJ’s reinstatement. If expelled, the DJ may appeal to the entire Executive Board to overturn the terms of the expulsion by majority vote.
