Card Access Basics
------------------

A list of station members is submitted to the Tufts University Policy Department (TUPD) every season. New community volunteers and Tufts alumni need to pick up an ID card from TUPD. Station members should tap and swipe their ID cards on both the tap and swipe styles of card readers in order to prevent card expiry. Cards expire if not used frequently. Access does not carry over between seasons.

What To Do If Your Card Stops Working
-------------------------------------

If your card stops working, please contact the Program Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org") as soon as possible. It can take several days to have card access reinstated.

What To Do If Your Card Stops Working, And You Need To Get Into The Station To Do Your Show
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First try calling the WMFO studio line at (617) 627-3800 or (508) 507-9636. If there is a DJ in the studio, he or she will let you in to the building. If no one is in the studio, call TUPD’s non-emergency line at (617) 627-3030. Give them your name, affiliation, and student ID number (if applicable). Tell them you need to get into WMFO on the third floor of Curtis Hall. They may unlock the door for you or ask you to walk down to the station in Dowling Garage to pick up a temporary ID card. Once you are in the station, email the Programming Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org") to let him or her know that you do not have card access and need it reactivated. It can take several days to have card access reinstated.

What To Do If You Can't Access The Music Department Office or Studio B
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have already been trained, make sure you submitted a DJ Agreement. Second, contact the Programming Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org"). If you have not been trained, contact the Music Director at [md@wmfo.org](mailto:md@wmfo.org "mailto:md@wmfo.org") to set up training if you want access to the Music Department Office, or contact On The Side at [ontheside@wmfo.org](mailto:ontheside@wmfo.org "mailto:ontheside@wmfo.org") to set up training if you want access to Studio B.
