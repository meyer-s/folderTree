-   ***DJ Portal*** - The [DJ portal](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Code/DJ_Portal "DJ Portal") is still in the planning and development stages. We hope to make it a one stop shop for DJs while they are in the station. It will provide real time streaming listener info, volunteer logging, chat windows, ticket giveaways, and everything else a DJ needs in front of them while on the air.
