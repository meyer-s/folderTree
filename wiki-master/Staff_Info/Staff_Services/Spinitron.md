WMFO uses [Spinitron.com](http://www.spinitron.com/ "http://www.spinitron.com/") to log the material we play over the air and online. Logging your playlists and talk subjects to Spinitron in real time during your show is mandatory for all WMFO DJs. Logging to Spinitron helps us to meet our sound performance reporting obligations. It also provides a service to our listeners by allowing them to view what is currently playing on WMFO or what played at any previous point in time. The "Now Playing" and RRS feeds are all drawn form the Spinitron servers.
