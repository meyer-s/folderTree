General Staff Info
------------------

This section contains information for WMFO's General Staff regarding WMFO.

For more information, see the [WMFO Constitution](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Constitution "Constitution") and [Staff Information](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info "Staff Info") wiki pages.

### About the Station

WMFO is a student-run FM broadcast station owned by the Trustees of Tufts University and run entirely by Tufts students. WMFO is a home to radio shows hosted by both Tufts students and members of the Medford/Somerville community. WMFO is governed and run by the Executive Board, a group of student staff members elected each year by the General Staff. For more information on the Executive Board, please visit the [Executive Board](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board "Executive Board") page on the WMFO Wiki.

### General Staff

WMFO DJs, Subs, and other volunteers constitute the station's General Staff. DJs can either host weekly or bi-weekly shows or be Substitutes (Subs), filling in for DJs who cannot attend their own shows. Other volunteers are involved in critical departments at WMFO such as the Music Department, the Operations Department, the Publicity Department, and On The Side, WMFO's recording studio arm. Once you become a member of the General Staff, there are certain legal obligations and responsibilities to the station that you must adhere to.

General Staff meetings occur once a semester and allow staff members to raise concerns, receive scheduling information, and participate in station-wide decisions such as Executive Board elections and larger station policy initiatives. General Staff meetings are announced via [WMFO's General Staff Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups"). Attendance is required.

#### Becoming a DJ or Sub

Training occurs once per semester, and is overseen by the [Training Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Training_Office "Training Office"). Training takes place over a three-week period. During this time, trainees attend a designated show once a week where they learn both the technical and personal aspects of hosting a radio show. In the first week, the trainer (i.e. show host) will demonstrate how the station operates. In the second and third weeks, trainees practice hosting the show. This includes gaining familiarity with the board, phones, and WMFO's vast library of music. After trainees complete training, they must pass a quiz on WMFO's Training Education Management System (TEMS) in order to receive a Show Application and Scheduling Form (Show Form) and DJ Agreement and Information Form (DJ Agreement). These forms are turned in as part of a Show Application Packet and evaluated by the Executive Board. The Show Application Packet is then processed in WMFO's scheduling process. Once scheduling has been completed and the new schedule has been announced via [WMFO's General Staff Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups"), all trainees are considered full General Staff members privy to all the rights and responsibilities that being a WMFO staff member entails.

#### Becoming a Volunteer

All volunteers are trained by their relevant departments. After trainees complete training, they must turn in a DJ Agreement and Information Form (DJ Agreement) every semester that they will be involved with WMFO. If a DJ Agreement was turned in as part of a Show Application Packet for a given semester, a second DJ Agreement does not need to be turned in. Once a DJ Agreement has been turned in **and station access has been confirmed** by the [Program Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept. "Programming Dept."), all volunteers are considered full General Staff members privy to all the rights and responsibilities that being a WMFO staff member entails.

#### Getting Access to the Station

Upon the completion of training and scheduling, Tufts ID cards are authorized to open the touch-acess exterior door to Curtis Hall as well as the two card-swipe doors in Curtis Hall. All new General Staff members will be notified by the [Program Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept. "Programming Dept.") via [WMFO's General Staff Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups") once cards have been authorized. If you are a community member or Tufts alum, you must then go to Administrative Services in the garage of Dowling Hall to obtain a Tufts ID card. For more information, please visit the [Card Access](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Card_Access "Card Access") page on the Wiki.

#### Station Responsibilities

In order to retain membership at WMFO, General Staff members must adhere to station policies outlined in the [WMFO Constitution](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Constitution "Constitution") and on the [General Policies](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/General_Policies "General Policies") page on the WMFO Wiki regarding both personal behavior and responsibilities to the station. In addition, DJs are responsible for completing five (5) volunteer hours each semester they have a show. If you are a Substitute for a semester, you are responsible for three (3) non-subbing volunteer hours in order to remain active. All General Staff members are also required to attend General Staff meetings held at the beginning of each semester. All General Staff members are also required to join and read/receive all emails sent to [WMFO's General Staff Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff"). All DJs and Subs are also required to join (and use) [Spinitron](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Services/Spinitron "http://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Services/Spinitron") and [WMFO's Sub Request List](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist").
