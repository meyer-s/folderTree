Engineer Guidelines

As an audio engineer it is your job to record with the best quality you possibly can. You are in charge of running the session, telling the band where to set up, where to stand, when to play, etc. However, it is also your job to ensure a welcoming environment for all of WMFO’s guests who come in to perform. This necessitates a few rules/tips you should follow:

 1. **Be Polite** and **Help**. The band should be expecting to carry all their gear up to the station themselves, however, if the band asks you for help carrying things up and you are not busy preparing for the session, you should help them.
 2. **Only one engineer is in charge of the session**. A secondary engineer or even some trainees may be present but it is necessary that the band is aware who is running the session. This helps facilitate communication between you and the band and establishes that there is a clear chain of command.
 3. **Explain the general outline of the session at the beginning**. This would generally be load in, set up, sound check, on air/recording, and then tear down. If the band or a band member is late or taking too long to set up, politely explain to them that you are on a tight schedule and need to get set up quickly so that the engineers have enough time to sound check while still giving the band ample on air/recording time. When giving explanations, try to explain the reasons behind your actions. That being said, remain open to suggestions from the band as they may want a particular sound and know their equipment better than you.
 4. **Be Diplomatic when resolving conflict**. It is the host’s responsibility to address issues regarding the band be it tardiness, behavior, etc.  If this is a live performance, talk to the DJ who is hosting the band. Explain what your problems are and why they are preventing you from doing the job you need to do. Don’t reveal your frustration to the band. If you need a second to calm down, tactfully excuse yourself and take a breather. If there is an ongoing problem you or the host cannot solve; call Joel, the OTS director(s), or the GM and they will assist you in resolving the issue.
 5. **Bottom line**. A band should never leave the studio displeased or with a negative view of our station and its services.
