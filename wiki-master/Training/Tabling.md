We get asked to play music at various campus events, and it's also a great publicity tool. Here's how to work the required equipment. It's heavy, so you'll want a car to trek it around the hill.

### Allen & Heath for DJs

The mobile Allen & Heath board is what you'll do your mixing on, and works rather differently from the Axia baord in Studio A. For starters, the grey faders are mono (like mics), the blue faders are stereo (like your iPod out), don't worry about the yellow one, and the red faders are the master volume. The input jacks, knobs, and fader in a vertical strip all go together.

### What to bring

-   The Allen & Heath from Tech 2, in its big Gator case. It should have a power cable and two aux cables (dual 1/4" TS to single 1/8" TRS aka headphone jack), if not bring some.
-   The speakers and their poles, and power cables for them.
-   Extension cords and power strips.
-   2 mics (SM58 or Beta58) and stands.
-   5 XLR cables: two for the speakers, two for the mics, one spare.
-   The swag box, with the banner and gaffers tape and swag.
-   Optionally, a pair of headphones.
-   A table, if one is not provided.

Keep track of it (especially the mics) and make sure they all get home.

### Setup

-   Connect the mic(s) to mono faders via XLR.
-   Connect the aux cables to stereo faders. They go to the connectors go in the lower of the two pairs above the fader. Follow the red/white convention on the RCA connectors above them (which aren't part of the fader).
-   Connect the main out XLR to the speakers, which need power and also have gain knobs on the back.
-   Plug in the board and press the power switch on the back.
-   Also, hang the banner on the table.

### Operation

-   For faders you are using, unmute them (above the fader), put the gain up (red knob at top of fader, in different spots for mono and stereo), and put the fader up when in use.
-   Put the red master volume fader up.
-   Optionally, mess around with the frequency controls until the source sounds good.
