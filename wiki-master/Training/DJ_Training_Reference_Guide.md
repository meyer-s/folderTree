General Station Info

### Rooms within WMFO

-   Studios - Studio A is the primary on-air studio. Studio B is used for band mixing and recording proceedures. Studio C is the auxiliary studio which is capable of recording as well as an alternate/backup studio for on or off air use. Studio Dee (in honor of Mikey Dee of On The Town) is the "live" band room.
-   Bathroom
-   Libraries - Lots of music on the walls. Probably a fire hazard.

### The Executive Board

-   **Searching** - Press search and key in. Keep the "First 100" checked unless you're pulling a lot of songs. (make sure you don't accidentally do an empty query without first 100 checked) To help you out you can reorder alphabetically by song title or artist.
-   **Continuous/Single - **The button in the upper right changes whether songs play consecutively or stop when the end of the song is reached
-   **Playlists**
-   **Playing PSAs and station IDs -**Run a blank search under the PSA or ID category. You can also use the colorful panels to play a PSA. Just click to start.

### The Phone

#### Answering the Phone off-air

-   Press phone button to "unhook" the phone.
-   Hold preview and press talkback.
-   Speak into DJ mic (1) and listen through DJ headphones

#### Putting a Caller on Air

How to put a phone call on air:

Answer the phone by pressing the phone button.  You must be sure you let the person know that they will be put/are on the air.

-   Take phone off preview or talkback (if applicable)
-   Turn on the channel and move telephone slider up
-   Mic 1 (or other microphone) must ALSO be on-air for you to be heard as well.
-   You can talk into the microphone and you will hear the caller through the headphones.
-   When you’re done, press off button on telephone slider and lower the slider. Hang up by pressing the phone button again.
-   If you answer the call to air, you must tell them they are on the air right away: "WMFO, you're on the air!"

General Policies
----------------

### Visitors

-   DJs are responsible for all non-staff persons in the studio during their show. 
-   On-air DJ is ultimately responsible for anything a guest does, says or breaks during their show.
-   This policy includes "Recurring Guests" or untrained Co-Hosts.

### Volunteering Requirements

-   Log hours in the book by the door. (Possibility of online system soon)
-   5 hours a semester
-   3 hours must come from activities other than on-air subbing

### On-Air Subbing

You may request a sub by emailing a brief note to wmfo-sublist@googlegroups. You may accept a sub opportunity by responding to a request received. You may request a sub for up to three shows per semester. There is no hard limit on how many shows you can sub, but please be curteous (If you have subbed 20 times in the past two weeks, try giving others a turn!).

We have had some confusion regarding this point recently, so this is important:

-   You MAY NOT "give" a show to your friend. All shows must go through the sub list
-   If you are going to miss more than three shows during a semester, please contact the Programming Director

Equipment Description/Use
-------------------------

### The Sound Board

-   Red "On" vs. Yellow "Off" Buttons
-   **Laptop Instructions - **Make sure that you turn your laptop volume UP ALL THE WAY. If you forget until music is already playing, holding the "shift" key will stop the clicking noise.
-   **Microphone Levels** - Start of by setting each fader to the red line (when viewed from standing up position). You should judge all levels by the far left meter with **"PGM 1"** written below it. The level on the far left meter should hover around the red mark on the meter. The levels turning red is not necessarily a bad thing. See the [DJ Handbook](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/DJ_Handbook "DJ Handbook")'s sound board section for a level diagram and pictures.
-   **Monitoring Section** (on the lower right) - Program 1 is the feed leaving the sound board. External 1 is the live feed from an in-station FM receiver. Exernal 2 is the Rivendell preview feed (when you're searching and press play). All of these sources can be listened on either the DJ headphones or the Monitors.

#### Sound Board Sources

-   Rivendell Slider
-   CD Player Sliders
-   Turntable Sliders
-   iPod/Input Slider (Aux 1 & 2)
-   Telephone Sliders
-   CD Players 1 – 3
-   Turntable
-   DJ Mixer Setup (look left)

#### Basic Sound Board Tips and Tricks

-   **Reset the Profile to Default:** Press the "Profile" Button in the upper right. You can hold for 5 seconds to reload.

-   **Previewing a Source:** Press preview button on desired channel and listen through headphones.

-   You can set a channel to Program 2 (make sure to shut program 1 off) and then set the monitors to Program 2 as well to listen off-air.

-   Typically Monitor listens to Ext1 feed (this is the feed from an actual receiver listening to the air. If you hear static, call someone.). Headphones listen to Program 1.

#### Broadcast Volume Levels

-   Put volume sliders near the red. Always remember, "Middle-ish is good-ish."
-   The blue bars should never peak and the bars should not turn constantly red.

#### Hosting bands live on air

-   If your trainees are interested in hosting bands and using these studios, make sure they know that they must be properly trained to do so before they attempt to.  If they need engineering assistance, they should contact [wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com")
