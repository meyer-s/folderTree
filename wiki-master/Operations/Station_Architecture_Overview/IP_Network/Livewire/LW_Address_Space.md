Basic Conventions

### Generating Livewire Address Assignments

Livewire address assignments are generated by hashing a Livewire capable device's IP address.

As discussed in the [IP conventions](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Operations/Diagrams_%26_Tables/IP_Address_Space "IP Address Space"), all Livewire capable devices are assigned IP addresses of the form 192.168.YYY.1XX. Thus, only the YYY and XX values are needed to generate a unique Livewire address for a device. Furthermore, all Livewire devices use only a single digit value for YYY, reducing it to just Y.

All normal Livewire addresses are located in the 1ZZZZ range. The 0ZZZZ range is reserved for temporary Livewire address assignments, testing, and for new Livewire device before they can be assigned permanent IPs and Livewire addresses.

To generate the ZZZZ value from a device's Y and XX values do the following:

1.  Treat ZZZZ as ABCD
2.  A = Y
3.  BC = XX
4.  D = Start at 0 and count up for each necessary Livewire source on a device.

 

This system only works on Livewire devices that have fewer than 10 channels per single-IP address device. A few Livewire devices have far more than 10 Livewire channels associated with a single IP (PowerStation, StudioEngine, etc). To handle these devices, we must enforce a limit on which IP addresses we will use in order to insure there is adequate hash table space available to allow the D value to overflow into the BC values. See the IP address conventions for more information on the IP restriction currently in place to support this extension of the hashing algorithm.

These channel numbers apply only to the Livewire *source**s* originating at the device in question. All sources, used or not, should be given their assigned address. Destinations are given the address of the source they receive, or 0 if unused.

Livewire Address Space
----------------------

The WMFO Livewire address assignments are as follows. Livewire addresses are generated by hashing IP addresses using the previous formula. Please consult the [IP Address Space](https://wiki.wmfo.org/index.php?title=Operations/Diagrams_%26_Tables/IP_Address_Space "IP Address Space") page for IP and related addressing assignments.
