Any current student on staff is able to run for any position on the WMFO Joint Board, except for the position of General Manager, for which a student must have previously served on one of the WMFO boards.

 

The board at WMFO is split into the **Executive Board** and the **Select Board**, which together constitute the [**WMFO Joint Board**](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board "Executive Board").

 

The **Executive Board** is the administrative body of the WMFO Joint Board, and consists of the following positions:

1.  The**[General Manager](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/GM's_Office "GM's Office")** is in charge of the nitty-gritty and general oversight of the entire station. In addition to managing and organizing structure within the WMFO Board, it is the General Manager’s job to organize and distribute all finances for the station. The General Manager is the point of contact to both the public and the university, and thus acts as the main consul between the Tufts Comunity Union and WMFO. Above all else, the General Manager is a project coordinator, and spends most of his or her time delegating, organizing structure, and relaying information. In short, the General Manager is the person to ensure that WMFO runs well and doesn’t collapse, even if he or she is not the person directly fixing or addressing an issue. The General Manager oversees all Executive Board and Select Board operations.
     The General Manager position is time-consuming, stressful, and takes no prisoners. As the face of the station, you are responsible for all of its successes and failures, and must be willing to innovate, think creatively, and understand both the current and future state of the station and board.
     In order to succeed as General Manager, one must be highly organized, punctual, and without ego. There is no advantage to having a technical vs. non-technical background, but being open-minded and able to learn the processes and functions of the station are absolutely necessary. The General manager works very closely with the Assistant General Managers and WMFO Executive Board.
     The General Manager reports to the WMFO Executive and Select Boards. In order to run for the position of General Manager, one must have previously served as a member of the WMFO Exec or Select Boards.
2.  The [**Assistant General Manager**](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/GM's_Office/Asst._GM's_Office "Asst. GM's Office"), or AGM helps with day to day running of WMFO and is a great way to get involved with higher leadership and technical functions in the board. Specific responsibilities are flexible and requires only help with donations drive. There are typically two. The AGM oversees the Business Director and reports to the WMFO Executive Board and General Manager.
3.  The [**Program Director**](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept.

     As there are over one hundred DJs active each fall and spring, being the Program Director is very work-intensive. You need really good communication skills and a lot of free time, because you are really involved in the day-to-day operation of the station. It is also helpful to have management experience. Being the Program Director has been a ton of work, but it's been the most exciting, fun, and valuable experience I have had at Tufts. When else in your life are you going to get to run a radio station?
