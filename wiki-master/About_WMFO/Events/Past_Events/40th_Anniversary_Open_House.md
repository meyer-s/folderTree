Description

Join us to meet fellow WMFO affiliates, catch up with old friends, tour our Curtis Hall facilities, and help us celebrate 40 years as Tufts Freeform Radio!  We at WMFO have been transmitting our Freeform signal on 91.5 FM from our Curtis Hall studios since 1970, and we figure it's about time to celebrate!  The event offers the opportunity for visitors to visit our radio station and see how our broadcasts work both over FM and online, meet the staff and management, check out our music collection and learn how we interact with musicians and the industry, and network with the community while enjoying refreshments and live-spun tunes.

The event is free and open to the public. Invite your friends and colleagues!  Directions and a map can be found on the [contact info page](https://wiki.wmfo.org/General_Info/Contact_Information "Contact Information").

As a courtesy, RSVPs are requested, but not required.
