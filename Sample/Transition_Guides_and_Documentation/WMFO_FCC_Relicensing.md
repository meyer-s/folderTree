The relicensing process occurrs every seven years and is the same for all radio stations in the state. The process is fairly simple in nature (don't believe all the hoo-rah that people try to sell you).

The primary concerns:

Public Comment Period and Announcements
---------------------------------------

The radio station is required to play a ton of announcements with content defined by the FCC at intervals defined by the FCC on days defined by the FCC.

They basically state that the renewal is happening and then ask for public comments. The full text of the announcement can be found (as of 2014) atÂ [http://www.fcc.gov/guides/license-re...dcast-stations](http://www.fcc.gov/guides/license-renewal-applications-radio-broadcast-stations "http://www.fcc.gov/guides/license-renewal-applications-radio-broadcast-stations"). We simply made a recording and loaded it into Rivendell, adding it to the automated system and to a single lower right RED PSA panel.

We found it easiest to enable an automatic override on the airfeed using Pathfinder which would swap the air feed over to a separate Rivendell instance running on Duke for exactly 60 seconds. Duke would then play the announcement. The result wasn't very clean but was vastly easier than having to have an exec member run down to the station at ridiculous intervals twice a month.

We would send an email to all the affected DJs describing the automatic override. At that point, we would ask them if they wanted to run the announcement manually. If a DJ "opted out," we would remove the override during the DJ's time slot and request that they notify us upon completion of the announcement and provide an approximate timestamp.

Paperwork
---------

There are several forms that need to be filled out, again visible on the FCC renewal page linked above.

Since the Trustees of Tufts College own the station, they hire a team of laywers to fill out the paperwork, who charge about \$2000 for their 10 minutes of time. You may wish to raise the question as to whether or not it is appropriate to pay that much money for so simple a service (especially given that they have, in recent memory, made a significant filing error in claiming that we had over 5 full time employees, requiring Equal Opportunity Employer status).

If they still want to pay the laywers crap tons of money, request that the bill NOT be forwarded to WMFO or TCU (as the radio station is owned by the trustees of Tufts College, those who ask for the relicensing services from the laywers should pay for those services upon their property).

Public File
-----------

At the point of relicensing, more than ever, you must have all the public filing "ducks in a row." Especially "Community Issue Reports" etc.

This is, according to Belinda, the "number one way in which college radio stations get screwed over by the FCC."

The PD should maintain the public issue reports with guidance from the Chief Operator.

Other
-----

That's basically the extent of the requirements. There is no ridiculous survey requirement or anything else. It probably makes sense to at least consult someone with FCC experience (Belinda Rawlins as of 2014) just in case there have been any additional requirements added.

Hopefully at least one of those methods will work in 2021 :)
