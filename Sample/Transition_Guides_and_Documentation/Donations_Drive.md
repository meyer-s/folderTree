About the Drive
---------------

The Donations Drive lasts two weeks, and occurs in the spring semester. The aim of the Donations Drive is to raise \$5000. Donations are placed online at donate.wmfo.org or via snail mail (checks) sent to:

WMFO

Attn: Donations

P.O. Box 53065

Medford, MA

Before the Drive
----------------

The GM or AGM(s) should contact Advancement prior to the drive to ensure that donations will be reported correctly.

During the Drive
----------------

The drive should be announced on the WMFO website and via the WMFO Staff elist ([wmfo-staff@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-staff@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-staff@googlegroups.com")). Station leadership should contact the WMFO Alumni elist ([wmfo-alumni@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-alumni@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-alumni@googlegroups.com")), the WMFO Listeners elist ([wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com")), and the WMFO Freeform elist ([wmfo-freeform@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-freeform@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-freeform@googlegroups.com")) as well. If prior donors' contact information is available, email them as well.

 

During the drive, DJs are required to play or read a Donation Drive PSA every hour in addition to the regular PSA requirement.

 

After the Drive

After the conclusion of the Donation Drive, Advancement should be sent a list of donor information. Advancement should then send each donor a letter and tax receipt. Station leadership should add all donors to the WMFO Listeners elist ([wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com")). An individual on the Executive Board should also undertake Donations Drive reward fulfillment. This consists of obtaining rewards and packaging material, addressing envelopes, writing thank-you letters, and mailing rewards.
