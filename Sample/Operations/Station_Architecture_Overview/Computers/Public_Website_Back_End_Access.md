Access back-end:
----------------

1.  go to www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/wp-login.php
2.  type in your username and password
3.  The "Posts" tab is for creating new posts that will appear on the homepage. Once the flow of the website is determined, difference categories can be applied to each post to display them in the appropriate area.
4.  The "Media" tab is for uploading images, videos, audio files, etc to a remote media library for later use in posts.
5.  The "Links" tab is not important for our site
6.  The "Pages" tab lets you edit the specific pages like "Schedule," "Photos," etc. - A lot of these are written in html, so make sure you double check before you edit anything.
7.  The "Comments" tab lets you manage comments.

 

You shouldn't need to access anything else for the time being. For the most part, everything is self-explainatory as wordpress aims at being extremely usable.
