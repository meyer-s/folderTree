Ridgid
------

The Ridgid set includes a drill, an impact wrench, two batteries, and a battery charger; a [flashlight](http://www.amazon.com/Cordless-Flashlight-R829-Battery-included/dp/B0011FK8KK/ "http://www.amazon.com/Cordless-Flashlight-R829-Battery-included/dp/B0011FK8KK/") for the batteries was bought on Amazon. The impact wrench, useful for stubborn screws, is in the Ridgid bag on the floor with the drill handle (not really useful) and printed documentation. Everything else is in plain sight in Tech 1.

Everything but the flashlight is part of a single set ([R9600](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203266851/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=ridgid&storeId=10051#.UJ05JkLFVAY "http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-203266851/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&keyword=ridgid&storeId=10051#.UJ05JkLFVAY")) [purchased](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_2MhICuqwGYeFk4YVdjUkhyVlU/edit "https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_2MhICuqwGYeFk4YVdjUkhyVlU/edit") at Home Depot on 10/14/12. It was registered for the Lifetime Service Agreement on 11/9/12 with the OCL address (for shipping and hopefully no junk) and the PO box (for junk) and the following information on [register.ridgidpower.com](https://register.ridgidpower.com "https://register.ridgidpower.com"):

Ryobi
-----

The Ryobi tools are older than the Ridgids and are in poor condition. They are stored in their case on the floor of Tech 1. They include a drill, a flashlight, and a battery charger. There are two 18V batteries, only one of which is remotely decent; there was a third that was discarded. There is also a reciprocating saw that uses the same batteries and, in a separate case, a corded drill.
