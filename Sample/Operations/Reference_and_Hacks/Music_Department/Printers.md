HP OfficeJet
------------

We obtained an HP Officejet Pro L7780 All-in-one that had been tossed out by the Clasics department. (Which means there's no warranty.) However it was found to be in working order and is currently in service.

It has a scanner, fax, copier, and color printer. Its IP is 192.168.5.91; the unit's WiFi is turned off. It takes the following 88XL HP cartridges:

**Cyan:**C9391A
 **Magenta:**C9392A
 **Yellow:**C9388A
 **Black:**C9396A

The door over the cartridges does not stay shut without tape, and the printer will not operate with it open.

If the printer does not seem to power on, push the power cable into the power brick under the desk.
