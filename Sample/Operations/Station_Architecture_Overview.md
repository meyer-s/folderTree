WMFO's core is an IP network. The IP network, besides supporting standard IP protocols, also runs Livewire audio streams through the proprietary protocol. The station architecture is thus best separated into the following categories:

1.  A standard IP network
    1.  over which we run a Livewire Audio over IP network

2.  Livewire hardware
3.  Audio Peripherals and Signal Chain
4.  Software Solutions and Computer Configurations
