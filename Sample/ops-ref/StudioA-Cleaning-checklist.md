All the things to look for in Studio A. This list is for small problems; for big problems, see [How To Fix The Board](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Axia_and_Telos/Fixing_the_Board "Fixing the Board").

### Facilities

-   Are the counters free of trash? Do they need to be wiped down? Abandoned property should be put on the DJ mailbox.
-   Is the studio dusty? Look for dust on the countertops, the board, the CD rack, etc.
-   Is the floor clean, particularly the area under the DJ?
-   Are there CDs left out? Are all CDs in the silver sticker rack silver stickered, and seated properly?
-   Is all the signage still hanging properly?
-   Are there any graffitti where it shouldn't be?
-   Are the windows closed and locked, with window shades down? In any inclement weather, this is the best way for them to be. (The leftmost window takes a little more effort to lock, but it does.) Are any window shades down?
-   Are the binders in the cubbies organized?
-   Is the cheat sheet on top of the CD player rack? Some DJs lean it against the mic stand, but they should put it back when done.
-   Is the thermostat set properly, at 72 degrees? Is the window AC unit secure, and set correctly?

### Equipment

-   Are the headphones all present, not broken (spares in tech 1, turn right), and tied down correctly? Are they on the table and not on the mic arms?
-   Are the aux cable labels still attached and their labels readable?
-   Are all the cables on the desk at least somewhat organized?
-   The microphones: do they all have their windscreens? Are they hanging horiztonally, with the labels readable? Do all 16 shock cords latch on the to short diagonal parts of the frame and not the horizontal or vertical parts? Are the screws that attach the shockmount to the arm tight?
-   Are the overhead speakers pointed at the DJ? And not, say at the counter arms? (You can be more accurate with this than you might think.)
-   Is the board set to a reasonable profile? I.e., not a specific show profile unless they are currently on-air.
-   Are the overheads set to external 1, and the headphones set to program 1, unless the DJ is using them otherwise?
-   Is Preview set to Stereo, and not Split or Off? Toggle with "Preview to headphones" on the right of the board and look for the setting on the monitor.
-   Are all faders set to program 1?
-   Do the phone faders show a single dot each?
-   Is there a fader with its options displayed onscreen, instead of being properly closed out of?
-   Are the computer screens aligned and positioned correctly?
-   Do the keyboard and mouse have enough cable slack? Is the keyboard propped up on its legs? Is one of them missing? (I've already canablaized one from Câ€¦)
-   Is [Rivendell](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Rivendell "Rivendell") open? Is automation on or off as appropriate?
-   Are the CD players on? Has anyone abandoned a CD in them? Is the tray left open (also applies to tape deck by DJ's right leg)?
-   Do all the turntables have headshells? Are the the tonearms properly stowed to the side? Are the circular metal peices in their homes in turntable pair to the left? Are the turntables and DJ mixer off, unless they're in use?
-   Does the UPS on top of the DJ computer not have any error messages?
