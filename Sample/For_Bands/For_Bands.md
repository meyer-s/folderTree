WMFO and On the Side are located on the 3rd floor of Curtis Hall at 474 Boston Avenue, Medford, MA 02155. It’s a good idea to park on the street in front of the station and unload your gear into the ground floor of Curtis Hall. You may then park on Boston Ave and return to carry your equipment upstairs.

When you arrive, contact the person who booked you so that you may let into the station. If you cannot reach your host, you can call the station at 617-627-3800 – this line goes to the DJ who is on the air. You may have to wait a bit or call back if the DJ is unable to immediately answer the phone.  

If you’re playing live, your session will be broadcast on 91.5 FM and streamed online through wmfo.org. Lastly, as WMFO and On the Side are college organizations, no alcohol or drugs are allowed in the building and our station is smoke free.

Band Responsibilities
---------------------

As the artist, there are a number of things you can do to ensure the session goes smoothly. First is to show up on time - for a radio show, this normally means 2 to 3 hours before you’re scheduled to go on. Being punctual will allow you to enjoy the benefit of a complete sound-check, enabling you to play your full set with professional sound quality. Drums are especially important to set up promptly, as it’s nearly impossible for the engineer to start mic-ing or setting up any other equipment until the drums are in place.

Second, as we are on the third floor and in a small room, it is a good idea to bring equipment you would use in a smaller venue. This not only allows easier movement around the room, but it also means less energy carrying your gear up and down three flights of stairs.

The engineer’s priority will be producing the best quality broadcast/recording. We will try to do our best to accommodate any requests, but a final decision will be made by the engineer based on the specific circumstances of the session.

How Will the Live Session Go?
-----------------------------

For the typical band, expect about an hour of load-in and set-up time. After this, you can sit in the lounge or the vinyl library while the engineer sets up mics, cables, etc. This should take around thirty minutes. After everything is set up, you’ll sound check for about an hour. At this point you should be ready to go on the air.

Be aware that these times are approximate. Each part may take more or less time depending on various circumstances. The two and a half hour prep time should provide enough leeway to get everything prepared so that you may go live on time with the best possible sound. However, expect to take the entire two and a half hours.  If we are ready earlier-sweet. Enjoy some relaxation before rocking the airwaves!
