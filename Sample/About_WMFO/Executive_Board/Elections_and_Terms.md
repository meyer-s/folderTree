General Info
------------

All WMFO Exec Board positions are elected at the Spring Staff meeting, generally held near the end of January. Any Tufts *undergraduate student* staff member who has been with the station for at least one semester is eligible to run for any position with the exception of General Manager. To run for General Manager, you must have served in a previous Executive Board position for at least one semester prior to running.

All terms are for 1 year and begin at the start of the summer season following the January election. The period between the January election and the start of the summer season is an interim training period. During this time, Exec Board elects will train for their positions under the currently serving exec board members.

There are no term limits (beyond the effective 4 year term limit imposed by the fact that only undergraduate students can hold office). All Exec board members are expected to put between 5 and 15 hours per week into the station, depending on their duties and position.

Election Order
