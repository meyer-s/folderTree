WMFO requires that all DJs contribute ***a minimum of five (5) volunteer hours per semester**.* No more than two (2) of these required hours may come from subbing. Subs are required to complete a minimum of three (3) non-subbing volunteer hours per semester. A list of volunteer opportunites can be found on the [Volunteer Opportunities](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Volunteering/Opportunities "Opportunities") page on the WMFO Wiki.

WMFO strongly recommends completing more volunteer hours than required, as volunteering is one of the two strongest factors used in determing a show rank in WMFO's scheduling process.

WMFO requires all DJs to adhere to a volunteering requirement in order to keep WMFO up and running as a freeform radio station for the years to come. WMFO does not require DJs to follow any show formula; we ask that DJs return the favor to WMFO by contributing to the station as a volunteer. WMFO has been a haven for students and community members as well as a producer of fantastic programming and community outreach efforts for 40 years. Please help WMFO to continue its freeform tradition!

If you are unable to attend a [scheduled WMFO volunteering session or event](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Volunteering/Opportunities "Volunteering Opportunities"), you must arrange dates and times with the [Volunteer Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Volunteering_Dept. "Volunteering Dept.") or have your work pre-approved by the [Volunteer Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Volunteering_Dept. "Volunteering Dept."). WMFO will not accept volunteer hours that have not been approved by the [Volunteer Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Volunteering_Dept. "Volunteering Dept.") or [WMFO Executive Board](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board "Executive Board") as hours towards the volunteering requirement. Additionally, at least three (3) of one's volunteer hours must be completed through work other than on-air subbing.

For more information regarding these requirements, please contact the [Volunteer Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Volunteering_Dept. "Volunteering Dept.") at [volunteer@wmfo.org](mailto:volunteer@wmfo.org "mailto:volunteer@wmfo.org").
