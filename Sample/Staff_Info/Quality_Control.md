Need volunteer hours?
 
If you're still short on volunteer hours (you are required to have at least five), you can do quality control for WMFO. You can do it at home; all you need to do is listen to a radio show and fill out a questionnaire.
 
We're awarding one volunteer hour per hour listened to (so you would get one hour for doing quality control on a one hour show, two hours for a two hour show, and so on). Questionnaires must be filled out completely and accurately in order to obtain volunteer hours.
 
If you are interested in doing quality control for WMFO, please visit [wmfo.org](http://wmfo.org "http://wmfo.org"). Click on the "Schedule" tab on the left. You will see WMFO's schedule. Click on a show you'd like to listen to. You can choose any show other than your own. You will then see a list of playlists and show archives, with one pair for each episode. Choose one of the episodes that aired within the past three weeks. To listen to the episode, click on the "Archive" button. To view the show playlist while you listen, click on the "Playlist" button. 
 
Then, while you listen to the show and look at the playlist, fill out our quality control survey at [qc.wmfo.org](http://qc.wmfo.org "http://qc.wmfo.org").
 
Anonymized comments will be shared with the DJs of reviewed shows.
 
If you have any questions about quality control, please contact the Program Director at [pd@wmfo.org](mailto:pd@wmfo.org "mailto:pd@wmfo.org").
