The following attempts to provide some insight into the order in which WMFO show times are assigned. Showtime preference is based on a number of factors, but most significantly volunteer hours and seniority. By knowing where you fall in the rank of show time preference, you should be able to use the information below to estimate what show times are most realistic for you to expect to receive.

\*The categorization of slots is based on the LAST edit made to that time. Some shows may have been edited after being originally placed, (e.g. to fix typo) coding them with less demand than in actuallity. Always assume a slot was assigned at the indicated time or EARLIER.
