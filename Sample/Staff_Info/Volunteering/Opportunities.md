WMFO hosts volunteering sessions open to all station staff. These sessions are pre-approved to count towards the **required 5 hours** per DJ, and **required 3 hours **per Sub. All sessions take place at the station. To view a calendar listing upcoming volunteer opportunities, please visit the [Staff Calendar](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Calendar "Staff Calendar").

### Volunteer Days

Volunteer days take place on certain weekend afternoons. They will be announced via [WMFO's General Staff Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups") (which you should be subscribed to and read). Traditionally, volunteers decide whether CDs are worth adding to Rivendell; we may ask you to bring a CD player (or laptop) and headphones for this purpose. Other tasks may include chalking, cleaning, or anything that a department head may need to be completed.

**Volunteer Days for the Fall 2014 semester** will be on:

-   Sunday, October 26            (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.)
-   Saturday, November 22        (12 p.m. to 4 p.m.)
-   Sunday, December 7            (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.)

### Quality Control

Listen to radio shows and fill out surveys in exchange for volunteer hours! Instructions may be found on the [Quality Control page](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Quality_Control "Quality Control").

Creative Content

You can join the [Publicity Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Publicity_Dept. "Publicity Dept.") and Assistant General Manager in Creative Content sessions, held from **10 - 11 p.m. on Wednesdays** in Fall 2013. Projects include producing new publicity materials, on-air promos, and station content. All are welcome!

### Ops Meetings

The [Operations Department](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Operations_Dept. "Operations Dept.") is responsible for the technical workings of the station. Most of that work is done at weekly ops meetings.  Technical experience (with power tools or computers) is a plus but not required. Tasks include programming, equipment maintenance, facilities improvements, and cleaning. Announcements regarding current projects and cancellations will be made on [the ops list](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-ops "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-ops"), an optional newsgroup. For the Spring 2014 semester, meeting times are **Saturdays at 1 p.m**. You can also contact [ops@wmfo.org](mailto:ops@wmfo.org "ops@wmfo.org") for more information on volunteering opportunities in the Ops Department.
