As a community radio station, WMFO airs at least one Public Service Announcement (PSA) each hour. If you have a PSA you would like us to broadcast on you or your organization's behalf, please submit it via the guidelines below.

### WMFO Public Service Announcement Guidelines

WMFO accepts both audio and hardcopy Public Service Announcements for informing our listener audience about non-commercial activities and issues. As a public broadcasting station there are no costs to the sponsoring organization for airing the PSAs. WMFO especially likes to help Tufts-based and local organizations promote their activities, and gives them special consideration.

All PSAs should include the name of the sponsoring organization, and if applicable, contact information such as a web site and phone number -- Note that long URLs can be both difficult for DJs to read on air as well as for listeners to remember, so it can be more effective to direct users to use a search engine with a phrase that readily finds your page (e.g. "For more information just search for 'Tufts Community Day' on the web").

Hardcopy PSAs should be printed on 8.5" x 11" letter size paper, and all fit on one side of one page. Audio PSAs should be either mailed to us in standard audio CD format, or emailed/linked as (preferably lossless) WAV or MP3 files.

PSAs are generally processed weekly on Thursday evenings for initial broadcast beginning on Friday evenings, so please submit PSAs to the station by 5 pm Thursdays for inclusion the following week. The longer the lead time, the more opportunities there are for the PSA to receive airplay, so it's best to submit PSAs in conjunction with the Thursday deadline so they'll have at least a week to run, but a month is even better.

The PSA Department applies its discretion regarding the broadcast of submitted announcements; in particular we don't permit those that are fundamentally advertisements from for-profit entities. Under no circumstances do we state any pricing information on the air. If a non-commercial organization is sponsoring an event that requires admission, we can mention the event, and where to go for more information, but not the particular cost.

WMFO DJs are free to air any approved PSA on their shows, so for maximum publicity an organization should submit both a hard copy PSA that can be read, and an audio PSA for those DJs that prefer to play them.

You can send your PSA to WMFO as follows:

Edward Beuchert
 Public Service Director
 WMFO 91.5 FM
 P.O. Box 53065
 Medford, MA 02155

You can also email your PSA as a plain text file, pdf, or legacy Word document (with a ".doc" extension but not ".docx" or XML) to [psa@wmfo.org](mailto:psa@wmfo.org "mailto:psa@wmfo.org"). Please include your group's affiliation and "PSA" on the subject line.
