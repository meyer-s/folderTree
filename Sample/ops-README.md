This page is designed to facilitate the ops learning process. There's a lot of information to know, most of which is not covered in any Tufts course. However, knowing how this station operates will give you a lot of practical, real world experience in:

1.  Network administration and Networking
2.  Linux System Administration
3.  Axia/Livewire configuration
4.  Hackery

The Ops Director or any former operations directors are great starting points if you have trouble finding information, but you can find most of what there is to know within this Wiki.

- Network
- Livewire overview (multicast, stream types, terminology) 
- Computers, vms (intro)
