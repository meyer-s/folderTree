The objective of the music department is to get new music into the hands of our dj's ASAP.  Towards this end,
 we have gone to a color-coding system (insert link here) and cubbies in Studio A based on time duration.  Mail is picked up by designated persons at the sub-PO on the ground floor of Curtis Hall or retrieved from Tufts Student Activities.  Mail is then taken into the Music Department office and opened.  Every piece of music put out for play should have a label with the date on it, a genre color dot on the spine, and a blank label or two for comments.

Jon Levinson and designated assistants will be checking music once a week and shifting contents from one cubbie to another.  If you are a music department person with access to the office you can assist in this process.  When mail is opened, if there is not enough time to do the entire process, sort new music by genre type on the shelves in the corner.  Refer to labels on shelves and if possible use dots on spines.  If you discard the publicity sheets, make a note on a label on the CD about any explicit lyric tracks and/or if the band/musician is coming to the Boston area.  There may well be some CDs and you should be able to recognize these that are home burns that are not really suitable for airplay.  If this is the case, they can go in the freebie bin.  We often get CDs without pub sheets that can be really wonderful but impossible to sort by genre at a quick glance.  We will have a listen and code section and this is where folks can assist in the music department.

So remember, labels on the front, try not to obscure artist or title, and dots on the spine.  There should be no unlabeled piece of music that goes out on the shelves. 

For CDs that you suspect people are waiting for and may covet, try to rip them before placing them out.  We have a fast and awesome ripper that does a great job.
