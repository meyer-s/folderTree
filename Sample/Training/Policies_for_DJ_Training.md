This page defines the WMFO DJ Training policies. These are the hard and fast rules and regulations that are required for a trainee to pass training and gain training credit. A violation in any of these policies will prevent any trainee from completing the training process successfully. Trainees will always have the option to complete training during a later semester and receive training credit, except in cases of extenuating circumstances as determined by the executive board.

Requirements
------------

Any individual may train with WMFO, no affiliation with Tufts is required. After proper completion of training that individual will have the right to apply for a show during the mid-semester scheduling process.

*People who do not reside at Tufts should be aware that it may be difficult to get a show at a reasonable hour after you complete training. Trainees register AFTER the majority of the radio station, and can only choose available times. WMFO cannot guarantee that we can provide an individual with a show time that will accomodate their schedule following completion of training. The executive board and the Programming Director ultimately have the final decision in who gets the first choice for a show time, generally based on a weighting which factors in seniority at the station and volunteer hours.*

Responsibilities as Trainee
---------------------------

Students are responsible for fullfilling the necessary steps of training based on the instructions received from the training coordinator. These include, but are not limited to:

1.  Attending the General Interest Meeting and informing the WMFO Training Coordinator of your interest in training.
2.  Creating the necessary accounts and subscribing to the necessary email lists.
3.  Informing the Training Coordinator **before** the registration window if you desire to train with a specific DJ, or else the student waives his/her right to choose a specific DJ.
4.  Familiarizing himself/herself with the important dates listed on the TEMS website and being responsible for meeting all deadlines.
5.  Logging on to TEMS within the registration window and choosing a show to train. (*In the event that none of the show times work, please promptly contact the Training Coordinator for alternate arrangements.)*
6.  Registering ONLY for a show time which the trainee can attend for both weeks.
7.  Attending both shows and fullfilling the requirements set fourth by the training DJ.
8.  Completing the quiz within the window set fourth by the Training Coordinator and listed on the TEMS website sidebar.
9.  Attending a final review session if sufficient score on the quiz is not attained.
10. Completing show forms within the necessary window and depositing them in the envelope in the Curtis Hall lobby (below the WMFO station).

 

Failing to complete any of these requirements by the deadline will forfeit the Trainee's credit for the current training semester. Trainees are welcome to repeat the process during the following semester.

The Training Coordinator has the authority but not the obligation to waive any of these requirements should special situations or needs arise.

Resolving Confusion
-------------------

If any trainee is confused about the policies or required steps, it is the sole responsibility of the trainee to contact the WMFO Training Coordinator to resolve confusion. WMFO is not responsible for any trainee's missing the deadlines because of the trainee's un-voiced lack of comprehension of any language provided.
